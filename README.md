Podcast Project for Acamica courses

This was part of the evaluation process for the Full-Stack Web Development Course.

Here I created a responsive, static Web page with onl HTML5 & CSS3. In addition the site allows you to listen to four podcast channels.
All of the design was made from a mock-up given to us.

Even though this was my first ever web page, i'm proud of what was accomplished
